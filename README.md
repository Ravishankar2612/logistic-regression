# logistic-regression
This assignment aims to examine the association of potential drug abuse/dependence prior to the last 12 months with major depression diagnosis in the last 12 months. among US adults aged from 18 to 30 years old (N=9535). All four explanatory variables were 4-level categorical and they were binned into 2 categories (0.=“No abuse/dependence, 1.=“Drug abuse/dependence”) for the purpose of these logistic models. More specifically, cannabis abuse/dependence (CANDEPPR12) is the primary explanatory variable and the potential confounding factors were cocaine (COCDEPPR12), heroine (HERDEPPR12) and alcohol (ALCDEPPR12). The response variable is major depression (MAJORDEP12) diagnosed in the last 12 months, which is categorical binary variable (0.=“No”, 1.=“Yes”). Therefore, we can evaluate if a specific drug abuse/dependence issue during the period prior to the last 12 months, is positively correlated with depression diagnosis in the last 12 months.
